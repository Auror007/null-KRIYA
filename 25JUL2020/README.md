# null KRIYA: 25 JULY, 2020

## Objective

1. Build a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app that consumes a [microservice](https://microservices.io/)
2. Manage the microservice using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html)
3. Collaborate with fellow hackers and get things done
4. Have fun!

## What are we learning?

1. Flutter
2. Microservices
3. Terraform

## Problem Statement

1. As a mobile app developer, develop a simple **Flutter** app that accepts a user input and displays a summary of keywords used by various users, so that users can suggest what technologies do they find interesting.
2. As a **microservice** developer, create a microservice that will save user inputs in a central repository, so that keywords submitted by various users could be collected and analysed.
3. As a **microservice** developer, create a microservice that will analyse all user inputs and generate a frequency table of unique keywords, so that this table could assist in decision making by suggesting technologies that maximum people are interested in.
4. As a **Terraform** expert, create the underlying environment for deploying the microservices.

## How do we collaborate?

1. [Commjunicate on Discord](https://discord.gg/CAm9Wz)
2. [Fork-and-merge on Github](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

## What is the expected end result?

The goal is to attempt solving the problem statements to the best of your abilities, leading to practical learning of new technologies, improved communication and collaboration skills.
